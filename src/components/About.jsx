          My name is Lucas Antonio Al√≠pio de Souza, I'm 22 years old. I've always liked math
          and technology, and mainly the world of games and because of that I decided to do Computer Engeneering
          which now I'm in my last year of college.
          During my time in here I've learned a lot of things, one of them was programming which I fell in
          love with. So I decided to be a developer and build a career.

        I'm looking to test and expand my knowledge in the programming area, both in front-end and 
        back-end. Currently, I am improving my skills in web development, learning about HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript, React and more.
